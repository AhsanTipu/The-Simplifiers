    <h6>The Simplifiers</h6>
    <br>
<p class="pc">
        The Simplifiers has been planning and executing high-end events through her own boutique company, Stacy McCain Event Planning, 
        for seven years.  It’s no secret that the Bay Area is home to some very talented Event Planners.  So what makes Stacy unique,
         you may be wondering? It is without a doubt, her passion and commitment to her clients. Perhaps the most exciting time for Stacy
          is the beginning stages of working with her clients.  This is a time during which she focuses on getting to know them on both a 
          professional and personal level.  Stacy understands that her clients hire her to be an extension of themselves; therefore she 
          strives to learn the ways in which she can stay true to their values, vision and goals.  Friendship, trust and confidence 
          flourish as she continues to work with her clients, culminating in an event that is flawlessly executed and remembered f
          or years to come.
</p>
<br>
<p class="pc">
        The Simplifiers understands that each wedding is unique, and that inevitable challenges are bound to arise during the planning process. 
         Stacy never tires of a challenge, and she prides herself on finding timely and ingenious ways of overcoming them.  She has a keen 
         eye for design and an uncanny knack for staying on top of all the little details.  Above all else, she demonstrates meticulous 
         planning and passion for perfection.  When the day of the event has finally arrived, you’ll find yourself worry free with complete 
         faith in Stacy and her team’s ability to execute the celebration you’ve been planning for months and dreaming about years.
